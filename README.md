new(/njuÀê/)halo
===========

Njuhalo is watcher written in Go. 
It watches croatian online store [njuskalo](https://www.njuskalo.hr) and
notifies owner for new occurrences of wanted items that match filters in config.

It supports mailgun and slack notifications at the moment.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:lpredova/njuhalo.git
```

Build the executable:
 
```bash
$ go build
```

or build it for specific architecture
```
env GOOS=target-OS GOARCH=target-architecture go build

```
where target-OS and target-architecture can be: 

```

You need to configure your watcher how often do you want to run it.
Supported alerting channels are email and slack.

You can customize queries and filters so as intervals between fetching each page, because you don't want to send too many requests and act as an idiot.


### Configuration

Configuration file is located in your home directory:

```bash
$ {$HOME}/.njuhalo
```

There are two files, config.json and njuhalo.db. Config file is the one that is meant to be modified.

```javascript
{
	"runIntervalMinutes": 1,
	"sleepIntervalSeconds": 2,
	"queries": [{
		"baseQueryPath": "iznajmljivanje-stanova/zagreb",
		"filters": {
			"locationId": "2619",
			"price[max]": "260",
			"mainArea[max]": "50"
		}
	}],
	"slack" : true,
	"slackToken": "",
	"slackChannelId" : "",
	"slackNotificationColor": "#fdcd00",
	"mail": true,
	"to": "myemail@gmail.com",
	"mailgunDomain":"",
	"mailgunAPIKey":"",
	"mailgunPublicKey":""
}

```

#### Create config file

If there is no such file you can create it manually or just run:

```bash
$ /.njuhalo i
```

#### Slack configuration
In order to configure slack notification you need to add token and channelId.
Token can be found here (if you don't have it, you must create it):

[https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens
](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)

To get channel ID simply enter web version of Slack and select wanted channel. After that simply copy last part of url:

[https://yourCompany.slack.com/messages/thisIsChannelId](https://yourCompany.slack.com/messages/thisIsChannelId) 


### Adding queries
Adding queries can be pain in the ass so you can simply paste it like this 

```bash
$ /.njuhalo a http://www.njuskalo.hr/path?query=1&query=2
```

That will parse query and save it to the default config file which also can be found on path:

```bash
$ {$HOME}/.njuhalo
```

Number of queries is not limited and you can add as much as you want.
If you messed up something, you can always clear all queries with clean option.

## Development

Location of all njuhalo config and db is in your home folder

```bash
$ {$HOME}/.njuhalo
```

To build binary from scratch:

```bash
$ go build
```
